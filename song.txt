Follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
Can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past, forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away in the wind of change
The wind of change blows straight to the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring
A freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika say
What my guitar want to sing
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Share their dreams with you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away in the wind of change
